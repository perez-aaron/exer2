 Steps on how to create GitHub page: For creating my website, I first created a simple html document where I would write down the content that I would like to present. Then, css is used to style the content into a way that is much more readable and pleasing to the eye. This is done through the use of flexboxes through which we can format the content easily.

 Key takeways: It is hard to keep track of inline and internal style tags, the usage of external style tags may be the best way to ensure a readable code.
